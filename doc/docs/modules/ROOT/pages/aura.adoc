== Overview

link:https://neo4j.com/cloud/aura/[Neo4j Aura] is a fully managed database as a service providing Neo4j.

== Remote Clients

Sometimes there will be remote applications that talk to Neo4j via official drivers, that want to use
streams functionality.  Best practices in these cases are:

* Always use a `neo4j+s://` driver URI when communicating with the cluster in the client application.  The optimal
driver URI will be provided by Aura itself when you create a database
* Consider creating a separate username/password for Spark access; avoid running all processes through the default
`neo4j` account.
