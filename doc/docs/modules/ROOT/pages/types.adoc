= Neo4j / Spark Data Types Reference

[abstract]
--
This chapter provides a reference to type compatibility issues between Neo4j and Spark
--

== Background

Neo4j and Cypher provide a link:https://neo4j.com/docs/java-reference/current/extending-neo4j/procedures-and-functions/values-and-types/[type system]
that describes how values are stored in the database, but these types do not always exactly match what Spark provides.

In some cases there are types that Neo4j provides that Spark does not have an equivalent for, and vice versa.  

== Type Mappings

.Spark to Neo4j Type Mappings Reference
|===
|Neo4j Type |Spark Type |Notes

|`String`
|`string`
|Example: `"Hello"`

|`Integer`
|`long`
|Example:  `12345`

|`Float`
|`double`
|Example: `3.141592`

|`Boolean`
|`boolean`
|Example:  `true`

|`Point`
|`struct { type: string, srid: integer, x: double, y: double, z: double }`
|For more information on spatial types in Neo4j, see link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/syntax/spatial/[Spatial values]

|`Date`
|`date`
|Example: `2020-09-11`

|`Time`
|`struct { type: string, value: string }`
|Example: `[offset-time, 12:14:08.209Z]`

|`LocalTime`
|`struct { type: string, value: string }`
|Example: `[local-time, 12:18:11.628]`

|`DateTime`
|`timestamp`
|Example: `2020-09-11 12:17:39.192`

|`LocalDateTime`
|`timestamp`
|Example: `2020-09-11 12:14:49.081`

|`Duration`
|`struct { type: string, months: long, days: long, seconds: long, nanonseconds: integer, value: string }`
|See link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/temporal/duration/[Temporal functions: duration]

|`Node`
|`struct { <id>: long, <labels>: array[string], (PROPERTIES) }`
|Nodes in Neo4j are represented as property containers; that is they appear as structs with properties corresponding to whatever properties were in the node.  _For ease of use it is usually better to return individual properties than a node from a query_

|`Relationship`
|`struct { <rel.id>: long, <rel.type>: string, <source.id>: long, <target.id>: long, (PROPERTIES) }`
|Relationships are returned as maps, identifying the source and target of the relationship, its type, along with properties (if any) of the relationship.  _For ease of use it is usually better to return individual properties than a relationship from a query_

|`Path`
|`string`
|Example: `path[(322)<-[20280:AIRLINE]-(33510)]`.  _For ease of use it is recommended to use link:https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/functions/list/[path functions] to return individual properties/aspects of a path from a query.

|`[Array of Same Type]`
|`array[element]`
|In Neo4j, arrays must be consistently typed (i.e. an array of all Float values).  The inner spark type matches the type mapping above.
