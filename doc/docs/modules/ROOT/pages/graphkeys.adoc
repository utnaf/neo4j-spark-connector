= Graph Keys

When using the connector to write data, it's necessary to indicate which elements of the dataframe correspond to 
the identifying properties / keys of the node that you're writing.

In the link:writing.html[Writing] section, the following options were discussed, applying to the "Keys" strategy.

* `node.keys`
* `relationship.source.node.keys`
* `relationship.target.node.keys`

The following sections describe how to use key mappings to express the connection between DataFrame format and desired graph schema.

== Graph Key Format

Each of these fields is a comma-separated list of keys, such as `field1,field2`.  In turn, each of the
keys themselves can contain a _mapping_ from a DataFrame attribute to a node property, such as `EventID:id`.

This mapping is always expressed in the order `DataFrameID:NodeID`, and allows for the data frame column name,
and the Neo4j node property name to differ.

== Simple Example

Probably the most common example will be to simply provide the name of a single attribute in the DataFrame;
the node will receive a property of the same name.

```
my_person_dataframe.write
  .format("org.spark.DataSource")
  .mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)
  .option("url", "bolt://localhost:7687")
  .option("labels", ":Person")
  .option("node.keys", "id")
  .save()
```

== Complex Example

For example, let's say that we wanted to write a dataframe of "Location" nodes.   Imagine we had a dataframe
that looked like this:

```
LocationName,LocationType
USA,Country
Richmond,City
```

Further, let's assume that we need a compound key (both attributes must be used to uniquely identify a node)
and that we want to use simpler names on node properties, so that we end up with Neo4j nodes like this:

```
(:Location { name: 'USA', type: 'Country' })
(:Location { name: 'Richmond', type: 'City' })
```

In order to do this, we would use the Graph Key expression of `"LocationName:name,LocationType:type"`

```
locations_dataframe.write
  .format("org.spark.DataSource")
  .mode(SaveMode.Overwrite)
  .option("url", "bolt://localhost:7687")
  .option("labels", ":Location")
  .option("node.keys", "LocationName:name,LocationType:type")
  .save()
```
